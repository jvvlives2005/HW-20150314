My Math Text-Based Game

So this is my Game. 


Comments:
I have not yet master how to deal with a bug like this: If the answer is one character, and the user inputed two characters, then there should be an error message. 
But instead, it recoginizes it to be wrong. I am not sure if it had to deal with char or char At, but will find out.
